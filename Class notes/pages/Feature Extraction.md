# Low Level Features
	- Directly derived from the signal (they do relate back to the musical properties in some or the other ways) -- Often Simple
		- MFCC
		- Zero Crossings Rate (ZCR)
		- Energy
		- RMS
	- Extracted from time domain representation or Frequency Domain Representation
	- [[Instantaneous Feature]] - A single value summarising particular feature value over one single frame of audio - A frame of audio can be defined by you depending on your task
-
- ## Energy
	- Volume/Loudness
	- Perceived loudness
	- Total Magnitude of the Signal - How Loud a Signal is
		- $\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x(i)|^2$
	- Energy - Cumulative power, more susceptible to peaks -
	- RMS - Follows the envelope of the audio smoothly
	-
- ## ZCR
	- High ZCR - High frequency, crosses zero more
	- Raw ZCR - gives total zcr count
	- Typical normal ZCR - Normalised by dividing with frame length
		- helps you to calculate ZCR regardless of frame length
